Totally unimplemented components:
   * TextArea
   * Tree
   * EditorPane (maybe call this something else)
   * Frame
   * PopupMenu
      * MenuItem
   * ComboItem

Partially implemneted components:
   * Table (needs event handling for contextMenu)
   * Field (needs verifier, contextMenu, handlers for button-type inputs like radio)
   * ComboBox (needs onChange and setting value does not actually select the child)

Fully Implemented components:
   * Button
   * Panel
   * Label
   * TabbedPane
      * Tab


There are many layout problems to be fixed still.

on_server/1 must be implemented
