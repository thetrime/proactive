Totally unimplemented components:
   * TextArea
   * EditorPane (maybe call this something else)
   * Frame
   * PopupMenu
      * MenuItem

Partially implemneted components:
   * Table (needs event handling for contextMenu)
   * Field (needs contextMenu, handlers for button-type inputs like radio)

Fully Implemented components:
   * Button
   * Panel
   * Label
   * Tree
   * TabbedPane
      * Tab
   * ComboBox (needs onChange and setting value does not actually select the child)
      * ComboItem

There are many layout problems to be fixed still. layout=grid, for example.

If possible, more efficiency needs to be wrung out of everything
